Hello there! The following links point to few resources here available about CS (*Computer Science*) concepts, exercises and related stuff. In particular, few of them are related to [Computer Science](https://www.mat.unical.it/informatica) course at [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.mat.unical.it/demacs), [University of Calabria](https://www.unical.it) (and they are mostly in italian, due to italian being the official language of the course). All of the resources are redacted by [me](http://www.francescocauteruccio.info).
